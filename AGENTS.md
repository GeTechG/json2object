# json2object — agent guide

Independent fork of `elnabo/json2object` (type safe Haxe/JSON (de)serializer). Its consumers pin it by commit; they do not dictate how it is worked on. This file is the source of truth here.

## Commits
- Every commit is **code** (library sources under `src/`, tests under `tests/`, upstream metadata) or **infrastructure** (the paths listed in `.github/infra-paths`: this file, `openspec/`, our CI and scripts). Never both — CI rejects a mixed commit.
- Code commit messages are written as for upstream `elnabo/json2object`: a plain imperative summary of the library change, no mention of consumers or their paths.
- OpenSpec artifacts (proposal, tasks, specs, archive) are infrastructure commits and never share a commit with code.
- An upstream PR is a cherry-pick of one task's code commits; keep them self-contained — they must build and pass the tests without any infrastructure commit.
- Changing the list of infrastructure paths is an infrastructure commit.

## Checks
Run before pushing:
- `bash .github/scripts/check-commit-kinds-test.sh` — self-test of the commit-kind check.
- `bash .github/scripts/check-commit-kinds.sh origin/master..HEAD` — the check on your branch.
- `haxe tests/build/build_interp.hxml` — the test suite on the interpreter (needs `haxelib install hxjsonast` and `haxelib install utest`); must end with `ALL TESTS OK`. Haxe version is pinned in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Specs
`openspec/` holds this fork's own specs (`openspec/specs/`). Behaviour or rule changes go through `openspec/changes/`.

## Workflow
No pull requests: this fork is worked on solo. Work lives on branches and lands on `master` by rebase or merge; the only mandatory gate is green checks (see *Checks*) on the exact tree that lands. Work is scheduled by baton — load the `/baton` skill before filing or picking up an issue, or changing an issue's status, labels, `footprint` or blockers.

An issue runs the same seven steps, in order:

1. **OpenSpec change.** Branch `change/<ISSUE-KEY>-<openspec-name>` from `origin/master` — one task, one branch — and write the change under `openspec/changes/`. Skip the OpenSpec change — here and in step 3 — when the work is mechanical, i.e. nothing the project history needs a record of (docs, renames, config, a plain bug fix with no behaviour or rule change); the other steps stay. An issue labeled `gate:spec` stops here: push the artifacts, post a short plan on the issue, add `needs-human`; continue once the maintainer swaps it for `spec:approved`.
2. **Implement** the tasks.
3. **Test.** Verify the implementation against the change, then sync its specs and archive it as the **last commit of the branch** (never a separate push to `master`), rebase onto current `master` and run the checks.
4. **Human QA — only if the change has it.** Steps only a human can do are written `- [ ] N.M [human] …` in `tasks.md`; agents never tick them. If there are any, post them on the issue as a checklist a human can follow cold, add `needs-human` and stop; continue once the maintainer removes the label. No `[human]` tasks → skip.
5. **Merge** into `master`: `git merge --ff-only` for a single commit or a short linear series, `git merge --no-ff` for a multi-commit change. Push `master`. If `master` moved since the checks ran, rebase and run them again first.
6. **Clean up**: delete the branch (local and remote) and its worktree.
7. **Set the issue done.**

The maintainer decides architecture and end-user behaviour, nothing else — steps 1 (`gate:spec`) and 4 are the only points where an agent waits for a human. Work without an issue: mechanical edits may go straight to `master`.
